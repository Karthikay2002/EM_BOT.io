The death count in emergencies is not high because of the people present there 
but also because of the people sent to rescue them. Sending our armed forces 
without proper knowledge of the situation always ends with more casualties than 
we expect. This is where we step in. We have an idea for a small and 
cost-effective rover that can provide a live video feed of the area and can be controlled via a web server. 
We are using IBM CLOUD to encapsulate the  live video feed from camera with object detection which also plays
a vital role in disaster management.
Our main aim is to assess situations more accurately before we have to risk any lives. The video is lag 
free and can also function during pitch darkness. We are also planning to use fire-resistant material if we 
get our hands on it. It is powered by a power bank and can work for an hour or two independently. Itâ€™s sad 
to say that a rover can be replaced but a human being cannot!! If provided with proper funding, this rover 
can be a revolutionary breakthrough for emergencies.  
Parts/software being used are:  
1. Raspberry pi 3 
2. Pi cam 
3. IBM Cloud
4. Chassis for rover  
5. Motor controller 
6. Web page for rover controls with login page 
7. Developing an app for future purposes and ease in using the rover 
8. Python programming for controls 
9. Html/javascript for web page integration 
10. Vnc viewer 
11. A special module for live video feed through the camera 

Step-1:-Live_Video_Feed Folder in the repo is a python cum html file which has controls of rover linked with a python script.

Step-2:-Directions Cgi folder in this repo has all input and oupt pin GPIO pins for Raspberry Pi which is linked with the above folder.

Step-3:-
